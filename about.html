        Hi, I'm Elena Isabelle Fabian. I'm a 3rd year Computer Science student at Northwestern University.
        Within CS, I've found myself gravitating towards an interest in systems,
        and I'm looking forward to peer mentoring Introduction to Computer Systems (CS 213) for the third time this
        winter.
        Fun fact: my favorite part is bomb lab and reading assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm pairing CS with a minor in Legal Studies,
        and I hope to study the intersections of technology and law after I complete my B.S.
        I'm looking to attend law school with a specific interest in Intellectual Property with a specialty in Patents.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of classes, I love reading with a cup of coffee,
        practicing yoga (maintaining that rhythmic gymnastics flexibility),
        and watching shows/movies with comedic and dramatic plots.
        Some of my favorites are Suits, Scandal, Legally Blonde,
        and you can probably see a theme...
        I also love to travel, and my most recent pictures here are from the
        Matyas-Templom at the Fisheman's Wharf and the Lake Balaton in Hungary.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love exploring and using CS and class experience,
        so if you're interested in my work or professional collaboration,
        browse my resume, or
        take advantage of the direct-to-Elena's-NU-email contact form.
        And if you just think I'm cool and want to be friends,
